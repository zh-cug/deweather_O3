The scripts to download meteorological meteorological conditions, process data, and generate figures of paper published in Atmospheric Environment (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119701).
The following flowchart shows how to use these scripts. It should be noted that some figures (i.e., Fig.4) generated by R scripts are edited by additional software (i.e., Adobe illustrator) to make them perfectly. 
All scripts are public accessible and if you encounter any problem please don't hesitate to contact me (zhengh2014@cug.edu.cn).
