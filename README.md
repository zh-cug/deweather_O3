The scripts to download meteorological meteorological conditions, process data, and generate figures of paper published in Atmospheric Environment (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119701). Some software should be installed prior to use these scripts, i.e., Climate Data Operator (https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo).
The following flowchart shows how to use these scripts. It should be noted that some figures (i.e., Fig.4) generated by R scripts are edited by additional software (i.e., Adobe illustrator) to make them perfectly. 
Due to the limited file size, the data used to produce figures are not uplpaded here and can be accessed via contact me.
All scripts are public accessible and if you encounter any problem please don't hesitate to contact me (zhengh2014@cug.edu.cn).
